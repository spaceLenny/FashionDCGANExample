# Fashion MNIST DCGAN
This is a pretty simple DCGAN thats been modified to work with FashionMNIST

You can download and unpack the FashionMNIST dataset here:

There are a couple of options for hyperparamters in the notebook to help stabilize the GAN losses. 

The [DCGAN paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf) is here and this is roughly based on this, plus various Medium articles I've read. 

Note that this was originally written in August 2017 and hasn't really been updated to more modern methods:

I'd love to hear from anyone who is using this. 

H/T to [@Don_Rubiel](https://twitter.com/Don_Rubiel) for reminding me that I did this, and asking me for it so it ended up here!
